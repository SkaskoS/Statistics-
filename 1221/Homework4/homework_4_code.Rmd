Read in data

```{r}
election <- read.csv("election.csv")
```

Problem 1c

```{r}
plot(election$growth, election$vote_pct, pch = 19,  xlab ="GDP Growth", ylab = "Incumbent Vote Percentage")
```

Problem 1d

```{r}
model <- lm(vote_pct ~ growth, data = election)
summary(model)
model$coefficients #lets you find the Linear Regression Equation model easier to look at

```

Problem 1e

```{r}
library(ggpubr)

election$residuals = residuals(model)
hist(election$residuals, xlab = "Residual", main = "Election Residual")
ggdensity(election$residuals) #show normality easier 
```

Problem 1f

```{r}
election$predicted = predict(model)
plot(election$predicted, election$residuals, pch = 19,
        xlab = "Predicted Value", ylab = "Residual")
abline(a=0, b=0)

```
