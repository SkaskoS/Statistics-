Read in data

```{r}
diet <- read.csv("diet.csv")
diet
```

Problem 1a

```{r}
diet$exercise == ifelse(diet$method == "exercise", 1, 0)
diet$diet == ifelse(diet$method == "diet", 1, 0)
diet$both = ifelse(diet$method == "both", 1, 0)

full <- lm(weight_lost ~ calories + method + calories*method, data = diet)
anova(full)

reduced <- lm(weight_lost ~ calories + method, data = diet)
anova(reduced)
```

Problem 1c

```{r}
full <- lm(weight_lost ~ calories + method + calories*method, data = diet)
summary(full)
anova(full)

reduced <- lm(weight_lost ~ calories, data = diet)
summary(reduced)
anova(reduced)

library(emmeans)

# Calculate adjusted means
means <- emmeans(full, ~ method, at = list(calories = mean(diet$calories)))
means
#Calculate Grand Mean of caloric intake 
grand_mean <- mean(diet$calories)
grand_mean


```
