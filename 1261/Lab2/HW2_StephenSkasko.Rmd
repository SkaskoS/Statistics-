#3, Will show all the code and output of it in each line of {r} used with no specifications on what to include or not 
```{r}
x <- 1:5
```
```{r}
x <- x + 1
```
```{r}
x
```
#4, Shows nothing since we are using the echo = FALSE with output of x being include = FALSE option 
```{r echo = FALSE}
x <- 1:5
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
x <- x + 1
```
```{r include = FALSE}
x
```

#5, Shows x values since we don't have include = FALSE 
```{r echo = FALSE}
x <- 1:5
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
x <- x + 1
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
x
```

#6, Shows the output when we dont have include = FALSE
```{r echo = FALSE}
x <- 1:5
```
```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
x <- x + 1
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
x
```

#9, If we having warning=FALSE then it takes away the warning in the output, but true includes the warnings
```{r warning=FALSE}
sqrt(-1)

```


#12, Some of the lines will show since they have include=TRUE but others will not since they set it to include=FALSE, but it seems that you can take separate R chunks to set it include=TRUE even after setting it to include=FALSE in one chunk

```{r chunk1, eval = TRUE, include = FALSE}
x <- 15
cat("assigning value to x.\n")
```
```{r chunk2, eval = TRUE, include = FALSE}
x <- x + 3
cat("updating value of x.\n")
```
```{r chunk3, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
cat("x =", x, "\n")
```
```{r chunk1, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
```
```{r chunk2, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
```
